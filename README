Hi,
For a long time I have beed collecting information about creation of plasmoids in Python. 
All that I found, I have implemented in this demo plasmoid (but many features are still in development).

Hopefully, it will be useful for you and help you to create more great plasmoids.

IMPLEMENTED SO FAR:
1. Notifications
2. Configuration management (plus configuration window)
3. Tooltips
4. Ability to change form-factor between panel plasmoids and desktop versions
5. Custom contextual actions
6. Transparent compilation of UI from *.ui files
7. Localization

PLANNED:
1. Wallet integration
2. DataEngines
3. Solid samples (eg. Networking)
4. Refactoring of current codebase
5. Your proposals.

NOTE:
1. Application does not use self.config() method provided by KDE SC due to some issues.
By default, skeleton implements ConfigParser.RawConfigParser as engine for manipulation with configuration.
