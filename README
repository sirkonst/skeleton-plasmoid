Hi,
For a long time I have been collecting information about creation of plasmoids in Python.  
All that I found, I have implemented in this demo (but many features are still in development). 
 
Hopefully, it will be useful for you and help you to create more great plasmoids. 
 
IMPLEMENTED SO FAR: 
1. Notifications 
2. Configuration management (plus configuration window) 
3. Tooltips 
4. Ability to change form-factor between panel plasmoids and desktop versions on-demand 
5. Custom contextual actions 
6. Transparent compilation of UI from *.ui files 
7. Localization 
8. Wallet integration 
 
PLANNED: 
* DataEngines 
* Solid samples (eg. Networking) 
* Refactoring of current codebase 
* Documentation 
* Your proposals. 
 
NOTE: 
1. Application does not use self.config() method provided by KDE SC due to some issues. 
By default, skeleton implements ConfigParser.RawConfigParser as engine for manipulation with configuration.
